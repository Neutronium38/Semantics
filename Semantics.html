            Characteristics
            Kanibo has two faces on its back and stomach resembling "oni (鬼)", a kind of demon in Japanese folklore. Its
            body is
            mainly a deep red color. It has six legs, with a tan upper part and a red lower part. Each leg ends with two
            claws. Like
            Kanki, Kanibo has a metal club-shaped claw, but upon evolution, it gains another one on its left arm. There
            are three
            pairs of spikes on its head, with two pairs on its head and another one closer to its back. It has a
            tan-colored jaw
            with yellow eyes.

        Origin
        Kanibo's design and Loomipedia entry likely refer to the heikegani (平家蟹), a species of crab whose shells
        resemble the
        faces of samurai and said in Japanese legend to have been the reincarnations of Heike (平家) samurai. Its design
        likely
        takes inspiration from Japanese oni (鬼), a troll or demon typically depicted as wielding a large kanabō (金棒).
        Kanibo is
        a portmanteau of the words "kani (蟹)", Japanese for crab, and "kanabō (金棒)", a spiked, two-handed samurai war
        club,
        referring to its spiky club-shaped pincers.

                <h1>Characteristics</h1>
                <p>Unlike its pre-evolved form and alternate evolution, Volkaloa is a quadruped. Its back is covered
                    with grass and has
                    small trees sprouting out of it. Two volcanic craters stick out of Volkaloa's back similar to a
                    camel's hump. Volkaloa
                    has a mask for its face with two horns sticking out from each side. The horns also emit an orange
                    flame. Orange lava
                    seeps out of Volkaloa's mouth and underside.</p>

                    long, three-fingered
                    arms with claws, and four roots that make up its legs. It wears the clothes from Halloween Kabunga
                    around its
                    midsection, above which is its face, which resembles a skull.</p>
